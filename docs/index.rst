Data Query in Julia
==============
In data analysis, one of the challenges faced by statisticians/data scientists/researchers is
the data cleaning. And for most of us coming from R and Python, we enjoyed the vast resources
of the documentations of our favorite packages, such as `R's dplyr`_ and `Python Pandas`_. And most
of our problems often have answers already on forums such as `Stack Overflow`_. Unfortunately,
this is not the case for Julia. And that is the motivation of this page, it aims to provide
compilation of all data queries in Julia. I do encourage readers to contribute examples, which
we will feature at the Contibuted section of different data query packages in Julia, namely
the DataFramesMeta.jl_ and the Query.jl_.

In particular, the documentation proceeds by reproducing the examples in RStudio's dplyr documentation
using DataFramesMeta.jl_ and Query.jl_.
