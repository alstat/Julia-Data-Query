==============
In data analysis, one of the challenges is the data cleaning. And coming from
R and Python background, Julia seems lacks some documentation on this topic.
I'm hoping that this page will serve as the compilation of all data manipulations
in Julia.

We'll try to reproduce the example in this site_.
