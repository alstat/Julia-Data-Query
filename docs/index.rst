Data Query in Julia
==============
In data analysis, one of the challenges faced by statisticians/data scientists/researchers is
the data cleaning. And for most of us coming from R and Python, we enjoyed the vast resources
of the documentations of our favorite packages, such as `R's dplyr`_ and `Python's Pandas`_. And most
of our problems often have answers already on forums such as `Stack Overflow`_. Unfortunately,
this is not the case for Julia, all we have right now is the active community, not only on Github_ but
on places such as Gitter_ and `Julia Discourse`_. And we like to grow the community even bigger by
inviting those involved with data queries in most of their work. And that is the motivation of this work,
by giving newcomers a good place to start their learning. This project aims to provide compilation of
examples of data queries in Julia. I do encourage readers to contribute their examples, even for as
simple as providing links to already asked questions at `Stack Overflow`_ and other forums for references.
We'll feature this at the Contibuted section of different Julia's data query packages, namely the DataFramesMeta.jl_ and the Query.jl_.

In particular, the documentation proceeds by reproducing the examples in RStudio's dplyr documentation
using DataFramesMeta.jl_ and Query.jl_.
