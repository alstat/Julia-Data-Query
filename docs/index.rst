Data Query in Julia
==============
In data analysis, one of the challenges faced by statisticians/data scientists/researchers is
the data cleaning. And for most of us coming from R and Python, we enjoyed the vast resources
of the documentations of our favorite packages, such as R's dplyr and Python Pandas. And most
of our problems often have been asked already on forums such as Stack Overflow. Unfortunately,
this is not the case for Julia. And that is the motivation of this page, it aims to provide
compilation of all data queries in Julia. I do encourage readers to contribute examples, which
we will feature at the Contibuted section of different data query packages in Julia, namely
the DataFramesMeta.jl and the Query.jl.

In particular, the documentation proceeds by reproducing the examples in RStudio's dplyr documentation
using DataFramesMeta.jl and Query.jl.
